# Space Tourism Website

This was my first project from Frontend Mentors [Space tourism website challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


# Aim

The aim was to create the above website as close as possible to the original design, although I did make a few tweaks and adjustments which changed the design a little.

### What I learned

This was a great project which I thoroughly enjoyed, as I am a Space nerd too! It was a great opportunity to practice flex and grid, as learning about customs properties and utility classes.

I also implemented a new way to display the mobile navigation, which I think I will continue to use in future designs.
